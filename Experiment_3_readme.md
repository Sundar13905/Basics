# Experiment 3
## Aim: -
To run and execute arithmetic ,logical, assignment and comparssion operators in C++ programming language

## Theory: -

### Different types of operations in C++ are as follows: - 
#### 1. Arithmetic Operation
#### 2. Logical Operations
#### 3. Assignment Operations 
#### 4. Comparssion Operations 
#### 5. Bitwise Operations 

### Arithmetic Operations: -
Arithmetic operations in C++ are there to operate mathemtical or arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. For example '+' is used for addition, '-' is used for subtraction and so on.
Examples of arithmetoc operations: -
x+5 //adding 5 to x
x-5 //subtraacting 5 to x
x*5 //multiplying 5 to x
x/5 //dividing 5 to x

### Logical Operations
Logical operations in C++ are there to operations like logical and, logical or, logical not, logical xor. Foe example '&&' is used for logical AND and '||' is used for logical OR and so on.
Example of logical Operations: - 
x> 5 && y>10 
meaning rhat is x less than 5 and y less than 10
This is mostly used for loops and conditions

### Comparssion Operations 
Comparsion Operations in C++ is there to operation like greater than, less than or equal to(not the assignmnet one), etc. Syntax is like ==(is used for comparssion) 
Examples: - 
==	equal to

!=	not equal	

x>	greater than

x<	less than	

>=	greater than or equal to	x

x<=	less than or equal to


### Assignment Operations
Assigment operations in C++ is there to operate opertaions which assign a value to a variavble. For example: - 
x += y ;             // equivalent to x = x + y
x -= y ;             // equivalent to x = x - y
a %= b ;           // equivalent to a = a % b
a *= b ;            // equivalent to a = a * b
a /= b ;            // equivalent to a = a / b


## Conclusion 
In this experiment we learnt how to code and execute assignmnet, logical, arithmetic, comparssion operators in C++.
